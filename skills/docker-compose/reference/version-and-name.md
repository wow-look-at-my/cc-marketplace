## Version top-level element (obsolete)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The top-level `version` property is defined by the Compose Specification for backward compatibility. It is only informative and you'll receive a warning message that it is obsolete if used. 

Compose always uses the most recent schema to validate the Compose file, regardless of the `version` field.

Compose validates whether it can fully parse the Compose file. If some fields are unknown, typically
because the Compose file was written with fields defined by a newer version of the Specification, you'll receive a warning message. 

## Name top-level element

The top-level `name` property is defined by the Compose Specification as the project name to be used if you don't set one explicitly.

Compose offers a way for you to override this name, and sets a
default project name to be used if the top-level `name` element is not set.

Whenever a project name is defined by top-level `name` or by some custom mechanism, it is exposed for
[interpolation](interpolation.md) and environment variable resolution as `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`

```yml
name: myapp

services:
  foo:
    image: busybox
    command: echo "I'm running ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}"
```

For more information on other ways to name Compose projects, see [Specify a project name](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/compose/how-tos/project-name.md).
