Develop lets Compose focus on the development use-case of running applications on a local machine. It also supports some development hooks to improve the velocity of your local workflow, also known as your "inner loop". 

This page defines how Compose behaves to efficiently assist you and defines the development constraints and workflows set by Compose. Only a subset of Compose file services may require a `develop` subsection.

## Illustrative example

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: example/webapp
    build: ./webapp
    develop:
      watch: 
        # sync static content
        - path: ./webapp/html
          action: sync
          target: /var/www
          ignore:
            - node_modules/

  backend:
    image: example/backend
    build: ./backend
    develop:
      watch: 
        # rebuild image and recreate service
        - path: ./backend/src
          action: rebuild
```

## Attributes

The `develop` subsection defines configuration options that are applied by Compose to assist you during development of a service with optimized workflows.

### `watch`

The `watch` attribute defines a list of rules that control automatic service updates based on local file changes. `watch` is a sequence, each individual item in the sequence defines a rule to be applied by 
Compose to monitor source code for changes. For more information, see [Use Compose Watch](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/compose/how-tos/file-watch.md).

#### `action`

`action` defines the action to take when changes are detected. If `action` is set to:

- `rebuild`: Compose rebuilds the service image based on the `build` section and recreates the service with the updated image.
- `restart`: Compose restarts the service container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.32.0 and later.
- `sync`: Compose keeps the existing service container(s) running, but synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute.
- `sync+restart`: Compose synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute, and then restarts the container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.23.0 and later.
- `sync+exec`: Compose synchronizes source files with container content according to the `target` attribute, and then executes a command inside the container. Available with Docker Compose version 2.32.0 and later.

#### `exec`

> Version-gated feature: "Compose exec". Check upstream for the minimum version.

`exec` is only relevant when `action` is set to `sync+exec`. Like [service hooks](services.md#post_start), `exec` is used to define the command to be run inside the container once it has started.

- `command`: Specifies the command to run once the container starts. This attribute is required, and you can choose to use either the shell form or the exec form.
- `user`: The user to run the command. If not set, the command is run with the same user as the main service command.
- `privileged`: Lets the command run with privileged access.
- `working_dir`: The working directory in which to run the command. If not set, it is run in the same working directory as the main service command.
- `environment`: Sets the environment variables to run the command. While the command inherits the environment variables defined for the service’s main command, this section lets you add new variables or override existing ones.

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: ...
    develop:
      watch: 
        # sync content then run command to reload service without interruption
        - path: ./etc/config
          action: sync+exec
          target: /etc/config/
          exec:
            command: app reload
```

#### `ignore`

The `ignore` attribute is used to define a list of patterns for paths to be ignored. Any updated file
that matches a pattern, or belongs to a folder that matches a pattern, won't trigger services to be re-created. 
The syntax is the same as `.dockerignore` file: 

- `*` matches 0 or more characters in a filename. 
- `?` matches a single character in filename. 
- `*/*` matches two nested folders with arbitrary names
- `**` matches an arbitrary number of nested folders

If the build context includes a `.dockerignore` file, the patterns in this file is loaded as implicit content
for the `ignores` file, and values set in the Compose model are appended.

#### `include`

It is sometimes easier to select files to be watched instead of declaring those that shouldn't be watched with `ignore`.

The `include` attribute is used to define a pattern, or a list of patterns, for paths to be considered for watching.
Only files that match these patterns will be considered when applying a watch rule. The syntax is the same as `ignore`.

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: example/backend
    develop:
      watch: 
        # rebuild image and recreate service
        - path: ./src
          include: "*.go"  
          action: rebuild
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> In many cases `include` patterns start with a wildcard (`*`) character. This has special meaning in YAML syntax
> to define an [alias node](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#alias-nodes) so you have to wrap pattern expression with quotes.

#### `initial_sync`

When using `sync+x` actions, it can be useful to ensure that files inside containers are up to date at the start of a new watch session.

The `initial_sync` attribute instructs the Compose runtime, if containers for the service already exist, to check that the files from the path attribute are in sync within the service containers.

#### `path`

`path` attribute defines the path to source code (relative to the project directory) to monitor for changes. Updates to any file
inside the path, which doesn't match any `ignore` rule, triggers the configured action.

#### `target`

`target` attribute only applies when `action` is configured for `sync`. Files within `path` that have changes are synchronized with the container's filesystem, so that the latter is always running with up-to-date content.
